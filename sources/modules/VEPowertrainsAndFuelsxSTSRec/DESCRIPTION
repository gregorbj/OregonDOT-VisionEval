    with characteristics for their region. Calculates the carbon intensity of 
    fuels and assigns powertrains and powertrain characteristics to household 
    vehicles and car service vehicles. The default values are for the Oregon
    DOT Statewide Transportation Strategy recommended scenario as of October 10, 
    2019.
